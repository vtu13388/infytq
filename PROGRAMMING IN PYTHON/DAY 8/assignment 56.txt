'''Write a python program that accepts a text and displays a string which contains the word with the largest frequency in the text and the frequency itself separated by a space.

Rules:
1.The word should have the largest frequency.
2.In case multiple words have the same frequency, then choose the word that has the maximum length.
Assumptions:
1.The text has no special characters other than space.
2.The text would begin with a word and there will be only a single space between the words.
Note:Perform case insensitive string comparisons wherever necessary.

"Work like you do not need money love like you have never been hurt and dance like no one is watching"			like 3
"Courage is not the absence of fear but rather the judgement that something else is more important than fear"		fear 2'''
