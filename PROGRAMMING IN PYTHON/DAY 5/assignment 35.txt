'''A teacher is in the process of generating few reports based on the marks scored by the students of her class in a project based assessment.
Assume that the marks of her 10 students are available in a tuple. The marks are out of 25.


Write a python program to implement the following functions:

find_more_than_average(): Find and return the percentage of students who have scored more than the average mark of the class.
generate_frequency(): Find how many students have scored the same marks. For example, how many have scored 0, how many have scored 1, how many have scored 3â€¦.how many have scored 25. The result should be populated in a list and returned.
sort_marks(): Sort the marks in the increasing order from 0 to 25. The sorted values should be populated in a list and returned.

Sample Input						Expected Output
list_of_marks = (12,18,25,24,2,5,18,20,20,21)		70.0
							[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1]
							[2, 5, 12, 18, 18, 20, 20, 21, 24, 25]'''
