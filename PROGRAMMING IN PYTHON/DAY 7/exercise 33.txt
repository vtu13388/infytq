'''Write a python program to guess the number in the user's mind.

randrange function of random module can be used to guess the number in user’s mind.

Note: User should think of a number which is in between 1 and 10 (both inclusive).

Random Range values	Sample number in user’s mind	Number guessed	       Expected Output
1 to 10				5	                   3	                 Number is low
							   7			 Number is high
							   5		  	 You have got it right!!!
