'''In a fair coin we have an equal chance (50%) of either getting a ‘head’ or ‘tail’.  
That is if we toss the coin a large number of times we would observe head approximately 50% of the time. Write a program to implement a biased coin toss where the chance of getting a head is 70% (and tail 30%). 
That is if we invoke the program 1000 times we should see the head randomly approximately 700 times.'''
