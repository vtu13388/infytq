'''A better solution would be to modularize the code and separate the logic for Mobiles and Shoes.


Modify the code as per the below guidelines:


Create two functions: purchase_mobile and purchase_shoe
purchase_mobile() takes two parameters: price and brand
purchase_shoe() takes two parameters: price and material
If the mobile brand is “Apple”, discount is 10%, else discount is 5%
If the shoe material is “leather”, tax is 5%, else tax is 2%'''
