'''Write a python program to solve a classic ancient Chinese puzzle.

We count 35 heads and 94 legs among the chickens and rabbits in a farm. How many rabbits and how many chickens do we have?

"""EXPLANATION
x = no. of chickens
y = no. of rabbits
x+y = no. of heads  ---- (1)
    2x + 4y = no. of legs
or  x+2y = (legs/2) ----- (2)
heads - y + 2y = (legs/2) ,i.e substitute (1) in (2)
hence, y = (legs/2) - heads
       x = heads - y
