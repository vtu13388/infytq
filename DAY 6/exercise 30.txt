'''The python function, find_average() given below, is written to accept a list of marks and return the average marks. On execution, the program is resulting in an error.

1: Add code to handle the exception occurring in the code.

2: Make the necessary correction in the program to remove the error.

3: Make the following changes in the code, execute, observe the results. Add code to handle the errors occurring in each case.

Case â€“ 1: Initialize m_list as ["1",2,3,4]'''
